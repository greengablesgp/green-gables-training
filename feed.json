So, I approach each horse as an individual,  with patience, consistent engagement, and positive reinforcement, balancing ring work with general life experience. I work to ensure that each horse is sound, comfortable, and physically capable and suitable for the job being asked of it. \n<br>\n<br>I do not offer quick results, since that would undermine the work. I aim to produce a horse that is adaptable, responsive and nonreactive (gently curbing behaviours like playing with umbrellas in paddocks, leaving the herd when on an outride, playing games under saddle and on the ground, riding out in a variety of weather conditions, and exposure to showgrounds, with safe and encouraging results). With the patience of a glacier and a sense of humour to laugh off whatever happens, I love helping a horse transform to help create a strong and happy relationship with their human.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greengablesgp.github.io/green-gables-training/media/posts/7/84698840_10151388187234990_5716168078711062528_n.jpg\" height=\"1638\" width=\"1638\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://greengablesgp.github.io/green-gables-training/media/posts/7/responsive/84698840_10151388187234990_5716168078711062528_n-xs.webp 300w ,https://greengablesgp.github.io/green-gables-training/media/posts/7/responsive/84698840_10151388187234990_5716168078711062528_n-sm.webp 480w ,https://greengablesgp.github.io/green-gables-training/media/posts/7/responsive/84698840_10151388187234990_5716168078711062528_n-md.webp 768w ,https://greengablesgp.github.io/green-gables-training/media/posts/7/responsive/84698840_10151388187234990_5716168078711062528_n-lg.webp 1024w ,https://greengablesgp.github.io/green-gables-training/media/posts/7/responsive/84698840_10151388187234990_5716168078711062528_n-xl.webp 1360w ,https://greengablesgp.github.io/green-gables-training/media/posts/7/responsive/84698840_10151388187234990_5716168078711062528_n-2xl.webp 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    I can always explain what I’m doing, why I’m doing it, the reaction I’m looking for, and how it is helping the horse, and I’m happy to do so while you ride.
