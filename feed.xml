  <p>
    I have over 30 years of international experience in the horse industry, from grooming,&nbsp; healthcare, and stable management to rated eventing and show jumping. I have ridden with Olympic and Grand Prix riders for over 20 years; I've had the opportunity to develop many great horses over that time.
<br>
<br>Some highlights include competing for 19 years on Canada’s national show jumping circuit and rated eventing in New Zealand, polocrosse in Zambia, extensive work with horses with behavioural issues, and running a trail horse lodge in Malawi.

  <p>
    My heart, despite all the competition, is in working with young horses, horses with behavioural issues, and horses that need retraining and help with their humans. 
<br>
<br>My aim is always to develop a horse that is happy, confident, and comfortable in their work. So, I approach each horse as an individual,  with patience, consistent engagement, and positive reinforcement, balancing ring work with general life experience. I work to ensure that each horse is sound, comfortable, and physically capable and suitable for the job being asked of it. 
<br>
<br>I do not offer quick results, since that would undermine the work. I aim to produce a horse that is adaptable, responsive and nonreactive (gently curbing behaviours like playing with umbrellas in paddocks, leaving the herd when on an outride, playing games under saddle and on the ground, riding out in a variety of weather conditions, and exposure to showgrounds, with safe and encouraging results). With the patience of a glacier and a sense of humour to laugh off whatever happens, I love helping a horse transform to help create a strong and happy relationship with their human.

  <p>
    I can always explain what I’m doing, why I’m doing it, the reaction I’m looking for, and how it is helping the horse, and I’m happy to do so while you ride. Coaching humans, however, is *not* my strength. If you need a coach to help you, there are many that I can recommend!
<br>
<br>The horse and their well-being are of paramount importance to me. Soundness, teeth, feet, body/back, tack fit, handling, and appropriate feeding are all constantly taken into consideration. I am comfortable with horses that spook, buck, bolt, spin, rear, stoppers, recently off-the-track Thoroughbreds, hot horses, etc. And I'm small enough to fit on ponies 13.2hh or larger.
